Today’s recruitment industry is trying every possible way to get best hire, but still they are unable to find desired candidates.
In hiring AI can be used to do repetitive and menial tasks such as sourcing the internet or filling out forms much faster than any Human.
Meanwhile, humans excel where machines falter: creating deep connections, observing and interpreting candidates’ behavior, and making decisions an empowering humans with AI can yield better results than he can accomplish alone.
Strategic use of artificial intelligence, combined with the personal touch of human recruiters can help companies fill open positions faster and with more qualified candidates. 
Now its time to replace ATS(Applicant Tracking System ) with iASA(INTELLIGENT AUTOMATED SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS).
